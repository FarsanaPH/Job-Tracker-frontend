# Personalized Job Tracker

A **real-world job application management tool** that helps users track every stage of their job hunt — from application to offer.  It includes all **CRUD functionalities, smart filters, application timelines, and visual statistics** to monitor progress.  
The app uses **React Context** for state management, reusable components for scalability and maintainability, and **React-Bootstrap** for a clean, responsive UI.
